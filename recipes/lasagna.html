Just make sure to keep the heat low so the pasta doesn't overcook and the bottom doesn't burn. You can make the sauce ahead of time - just reheat and continue with the recipe.</p>

    <li>Add the zucchini, basil or oregano and cook, covered, until the zucchini is golden and soft, 10 to 15 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the tomatoes and water, stir well. Reduce the heat to low and cook with the lid on for 10 minutes. Remove the lid and cook for about 10 minutes more.</li>
    <li>Turn off the heat, add the spinach and stir until the spinach is cooked.</li>
    <li>Carefully slide 4 pieces of lasagna into the pan, using the edges to slide them to the bottom of the sauce with the spatula, pushing them down to the bottom. Add another layer of 4 pieces of lasagna, then another 4 and pushing them down to the surface. Add the last 4 pieces of lasagna and spoon some of the tomato mixture over the top.
    <li>Add the ricotta cheese, 1 tablespoon at a time, dropping it onto the top. Sprinkle with the mozzarella cheese and then the Parmesan cheese.</li>
