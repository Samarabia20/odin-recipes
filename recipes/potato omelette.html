    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 medium potatoes (about 1/2 kg)</li>
      <li>medium onion</li>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>Oil to fry the potatoes</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
      <li>Pepper to taste (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>To start with this potato omelette recipe, begin by washing, peeling and cutting the potatoes “Spanish style”, that is, into slices of about 4 mm. This thickness of the slices is one of the tricks to make a perfect and delicious potato omelette, but there are more. However, you can also cut them into small cubes or triangles.</li>
      <li>Put the oil in the pan on high heat. When it is hot, fry the potatoes until they look well done, but it is not necessary to brown them. Another option is to just poach them in oil, depending on how you like the final result.</li>
      <li>When they are ready, set the potatoes aside on a plate. We recommend putting a piece of kitchen paper on the plate to remove excess oil from the potatoes.</li>
      <li>While the potatoes are draining on kitchen paper, as this is a recipe for potato omelette with onion, now it's time to cut the onion into cubes or half julienne strips, as in the image.</li>
      <li>Put the onion in the oil to cook it well over medium heat, you can still use the same oil you used to fry the potatoes. Fry the onion until the pieces look transparent.</li>
      <li>While the onion is cooking, take the opportunity to beat the 4 eggs in a bowl, with salt to taste and, if you want, also some pepper.</li>
      <li>Once the onions are transparent, add the beaten egg and the potatoes to the pan as shown in this image.</li>
      <li>Cook the potato omelette over low or medium heat, but checking the bottom with a spatula so that it doesn't stick or burn.</li>
      <li>To flip the potato omelette, you have to place the lid or plate on the pan and then, flip it so that the pan is on top and the plate or lid is below with the omelette resting on it. After this, you have to place the part of the omelette that was on top without cooking, and that is now below touching the plate or lid, on the surface of the pan, so that the omelette finishes cooking. To do this, carefully slide the omelette onto the pan, slowly tilting the lid or plate so that it falls into the right place in the pan and you can leave it well placed.</li>
      <li>Finish cooking the potato omelette over low heat for about 5 more minutes. Remove it from the pan and place it on a plate, ready to eat!</li>
